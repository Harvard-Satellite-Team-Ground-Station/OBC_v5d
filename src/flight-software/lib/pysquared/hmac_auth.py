"""This module provides HMAC-based authentication for command messages.

This module implements HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for
authenticating commands sent to the satellite. It provides protection against
unauthorized commands and replay attacks through the use of a shared secret
and packet counter.

**Usage:**
```python
from pysquared.hmac_auth import HMACAuthenticator

# On the ground station
authenticator = HMACAuthenticator("shared_secret_key")
message = '{"command": "send_joke", "name": "MySat"}'
counter = 42
hmac_value = authenticator.generate_hmac(message, counter)

# On the satellite
authenticator = HMACAuthenticator("shared_secret_key")
is_valid = authenticator.verify_hmac(message, counter, hmac_value)
```
